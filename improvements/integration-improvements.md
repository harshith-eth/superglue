- Add credential validation helpers to detect common auth issues early
- Implement structured error responses with error codes and resolution steps

### Tool Functionality
- Add built-in retry mechanisms with configurable backoff
- Implement caching options for frequently accessed data
- Add support for webhook registration and management
- Enhance pagination handling with configurable strategies

### Developer Experience
- Provide interactive examples in documentation
- Add SDK methods to simplify common MCP tool operations
- Implement typings for tool inputs and outputs
- Add helper functions for credential management

## API Client Improvements

### Client Library Enhancements
- Add more helper methods for common integration patterns
- Implement middleware support for request/response processing
- Add built-in logging with configurable levels
- Enhance typing for better developer experience

### Authentication Improvements

- Add token refresh handling
- Implement secure credential storage options
- Add support for service account authentication

### Error Handling
- Implement consistent error classification
- Add retry policies with exponential backoff
- Provide detailed error information with troubleshooting steps
- Add circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints

## Workflow Execution Improvements

- Implement streaming for large responses
- Add data validation at workflow boundaries

## Integration Testing

### Test Utilities
- Create mock servers for common integration targets
- Implement record/replay functionality for API testing
- Add integration test helpers to the SDK
- Create test fixtures for common integration scenarios

### CI/CD Integration
- Add GitHub Actions workflows for integration testing
- Implement automated credential rotation for test environments
- Add performance benchmarking in CI
- Implement API contract testing

## Common Integration Targets

### Popular API Integrations
- Add built-in helpers for common APIs (Stripe, HubSpot, Salesforce)
- Implement schema definitions for popular APIs
- Add documentation examples for widely-used services
- Create starter templates for common integration patterns

### Authentication Support
- Add OAuth flow helpers for common providers
- Implement API key management utilities
- Add JWT generation and validation helpers
- Support for multi-tenant authentication scenarios

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**:
   - Enhance error handling and validation in MCP tools
   - Add retry mechanisms with configurable backoff
   - Implement credential validation helpers
   - Add helper methods for common integration patterns

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add support for multiple authentication methods
   - Create integration test utilities
   - Add built-in helpers for common APIs

3. **Lower Priority**:
   - Implement parallel execution for workflow steps
   - Add support for webhook management
   - Create advanced monitoring tools
   - Implement streaming for large datasets

These improvements would significantly enhance SuperGlue's integration capabilities, making it more robust, developer-friendly, and capable of handling complex integration scenarios.
