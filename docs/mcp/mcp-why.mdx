title: "Why Use superglue MCP?"
description: "Let your agent build its own tools."
---

We’ve talked to dozens of teams deploying agents and they were all facing the same dilemma: Giving their agents enough freedom to fetch all the data they need, yet making sure that every call remains secure, performant, and predictable in production. **superglue MCP fixes this**: It gives you the reliability you’re looking for when deploying in prod, and agents the tools they actually need to do their job well.

## How Does superglue MCP Help?

superglue MCP is a lightweight API-wrapper available via MCP. Agents can use it to:

- **Merge multiple endpoints & APIs** into coherent, reusable, **custom tools**
- **Expose them via one stable MCP server**, even as upstream APIs change
- **Abstract away authentication, pagination, retries,** and mapping logic
- **Keep their toolset lean, so they don't get overwhelmed or go rogue**

Use supertools to let your agent run cross-API workflows reliably, like fetching transactions in Stripe and updating them in Hubspot, to build ambient agents that react to app triggers or to wrap your own API into capabilities agents can use.

## Connecting to the MCP Server

The superglue MCP server is available at the `/mcp` endpoint of your superglue instance.

- **Hosted Endpoint**: `https://mcp.superglue.ai/`
- **Self-Hosted Endpoint**: `http://<your-superglue-host>:<port>/mcp` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/mcp`)

```Connection String for Cursor / Windsurf / Claude Code (requires mcp-remote)
{
	"mcpServers": {
	  "superglue": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": [
				"mcp-remote",
				"https://mcp.superglue.ai",
				"--header",
				"Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
			],
			"env": {
				"AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer YOUR_SUPERGLUE_API_KEY"
			}	
	    }
	}
}
```

The reason this request is structured in an odd way (AUTH_HEADER instead of AUTH_TOKEN) is because Cursor does not allow spaces within the args array, but does so for env vars. This might become obsolete in future versions.

## Using superglueMCP Tools

Switch to the agent mode of your LLM interface and prompt to build or execute a superglue tool. All superglue tools are exposed through MCP. For the video example to work, you need to share your HubSpot API key when running the tool.

### Authentication

All requests to the MCP server must be authenticated. superglue's MCP integration uses a key-based authentication system just like the GQL endpoint, see [quickstart](/quickstart).

### Session Management

MCP interactions are session-based. A session allows the server to maintain context across multiple requests from the same client.

- **Establishing a Session**:
  - To start a new session, the client sends an MCP `initialize` request to the `/mcp` endpoint (typically via a POST request).
  - The server responds with a `sessionId` (e.g., in a header or the response body, though MCP standard usually involves the server generating it and the client then using it). The superglue implementation generates a UUID for the session.
- **Maintaining a Session**:
  - For subsequent requests within the same session, the client must include the `mcp-session-id` header with the value of the `sessionId` received during initialization.
  - `POST /mcp`: Used for most MCP requests like `listTools` and `callTool`.
  - `GET /mcp` & `DELETE /mcp`: The `handleMcpSessionRequest` in `mcp-server.ts` suggests these might be used for session-specific operations, requiring the `mcp-session-id` header. For example, to check session status or explicitly close a session if implemented.
