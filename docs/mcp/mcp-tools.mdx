title: "MCP Tools"
description: "superglue MCP provides tools for workflow creation, execution and integration code generation."
---

The following tools are exposed by superglue's MCP server. The input schemas are defined using Zod in `mcp-server.ts`.

#### 1. `superglue_execute_tool`

- **Description**: Execute a specific Superglue tool by ID. Use this when you know the exact tool needed for a task.
- **Input Schema**: `ExecuteToolInputSchema`
  - `id`: The ID of the tool to execute.
  - `payload`: (Optional) JSON payload to pass to the tool.
  - `credentials`: (Optional) JSON credentials for the tool execution.
  - `options`: (Optional) Request configuration (caching, timeouts, retries, etc.).

<Note>
  **Important Notes**

  - Tool ID must exist (use dynamic `execute_{tool_id}` tools to find valid IDs)
  - **CRITICAL**: Include **ALL** required credentials in the credentials object
  - Payload structure must match the tool's expected input schema
  - Returns execution results \+ SDK code for integration
</Note>

- **Example Usage (Conceptual MCP Call)**:

  ```json
  // MCP callTool params
  {
    "toolName": "superglue_execute_tool",
    "inputs": {
      "id": "tool-id-123",
      "payload": { "inputData": "example" },
      "credentials": { "apiKey": "your-api-key" }
    }
  }
  ```

#### 2. `superglue_build_new_tool`

- **Description**: Build a new integration tool from natural language instructions. Use when existing tools don't meet requirements. Built tools are immediately saved and dynamically made available as new tools.
- **Input Schema**: `BuildToolInputSchema`
  - `instruction`: Natural language instruction for building the tool.
  - `payload`: (Optional) Example JSON payload for the tool. This should be data needed to fulfill the request (e.g. a list of ids to loop over), not settings or filters.
  - `systems`: Array of `SystemInputSchema` defining the systems the tool can interact with.
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the system.
    - `urlHost`: Base URL/hostname for the system.
    - `urlPath`: (Optional) Base path for API calls.
    - `documentationUrl`: (Optional) URL to API documentation.
    - `credentials`: (Optional) Credentials for accessing the system. MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE ALL OF THEM BEFORE BUILDING THE CAPABILITY, OTHERWISE IT WILL FAIL.
  - `responseSchema`: (Optional) JSONSchema for the expected response structure.

<Note>
  **Important Notes:**

  - Gather **ALL** system credentials **BEFORE** building (API keys, tokens, documentation url if the system is less known)
  - Built workflows are saved, but not immediately executed
  - Provide detailed, specific instructions
  - superglue handles pagination for you, so you don't need to worry about it
  - Tool building may take 30-60 seconds
</Note>

- **Example Usage (Conceptual MCP Call)**:

  ```json
  // MCP callTool params
  {
    "toolName": "superglue_build_new_tool",
    "inputs": {
      "instruction": "Fetch user data from system A and send it to system B.",
      "systems": [
        { 
          "id": "systemA", 
          "urlHost": "https://api.systema.com",
          "credentials": { "apiKey": "system-a-key" }
        },
        { 
          "id": "systemB", 
          "urlHost": "https://api.systemb.com",
          "credentials": { "token": "system-b-token" }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

#### 3. `superglue_get_integration_code`

- **Description**: Generate integration code for a specific tool. Use this to show users how to implement a tool in their applications.
- **Input Schema**: `GenerateCodeInputSchema`
  - `toolId`: The ID of the tool to generate code for.
  - `language`: Programming language for the generated code (`typescript`, `python`, or `go`).

<Note>
  **Important Notes:**

  - Generates code in TypeScript, Python, or Go
  - Includes example payload and credentials based on the tool's input schema
  - Returns ready-to-use SDK code for integration
</Note>

- **Example Usage (Conceptual MCP Call)**:

  ```json
  // MCP callTool params
  {
    "toolName": "superglue_get_integration_code",
    "inputs": {
      "toolId": "tool-id-123",
      "language": "typescript"
    }
  }
  ```

### Dynamic Tool Execution

In addition to the static tools above, the MCP server dynamically creates execution tools for each of your existing Superglue workflows. These are named `execute_{tool_id}` and provide direct access to execute existing workflows.

### Dynamic Tool Schema

Each dynamic tool has the following input schema:

- `payload`: (Optional) JSON payload data for the tool
- `credentials`: (Optional) Authentication credentials for the tool
- `options`: (Optional) Request configuration (caching, timeouts, retries, etc.)

The exact schema is derived from the tool's `inputSchema` if available, otherwise it falls back to the flexible schema above.

### Example Dynamic Tool Usage

```json
// MCP callTool params for a tool with ID "stripe-to-hubspot-sync"
{
  "toolName": "execute_stripe-to-hubspot-sync",
  "inputs": {
    "payload": { "customerId": "cus_123" },
    "credentials": { 
      "stripeKey": "sk_test_...",
      "hubspotToken": "pat-na1-..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent Workflow

The recommended workflow for agents using the Superglue MCP server:

1. **DISCOVER**: List available tools using the dynamic `execute_{tool_id}` tools or by calling `superglue_execute_tool` with known IDs
2. **EXECUTE**: Use `superglue_execute_tool` for existing tools OR `superglue_build_new_tool` for new integrations
3. **INTEGRATE**: Use `superglue_get_integration_code` to show users how to implement tools in their applications

<Info>
  **Best Practices**

  - Always gather all credentials before building or executing tools
  - Use descriptive instructions when building new tools
  - Validate tool IDs exist before execution
  - Provide integration code when users ask "how do I use this?"
  - The server handles authentication, pagination, retries, and error handling automatically
