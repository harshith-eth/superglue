superglue is a self-healing integration agent. Deploy it as a proxy between you and any complex or legacy API, and always get the data you want in the format you expect.

Prompt superglue in natural language (e.g. "get all issues from jira"), provide an API URL, and superglue handles the rest:
- Generates API configs by analyzing docs
- Handles pagination, authentication, retries
- Creates deterministic transformations (using JSONata)
- Validates and fixes data to match your schema
- Uses LLMs only for config and mapping, so runtime is fast and cheap

It's open source and easy to run in your own infra.

* Creates deterministic transformation instructions using LLMs

* Validates output against JSON schemas

* Supports monitoring, error handling, self-healing out of the box

* Real-time log streaming via GraphQL subscriptions

* Use as a drop-in replacement for any API integration or as lightweight ETL
