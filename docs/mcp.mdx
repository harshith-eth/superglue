## why glue?

We’ve talked to dozens of teams deploying agents and they were all facing the same dilemma: giving their agents enough freedom to fetch all the data they need, yet making sure that every call remains secure, performant, and predictable in production. **MCPglue fixes this**: It gives you the reliability you’re looking for when deploying in prod, and agents the tools they actually need to do their job well.

## how does MCPglue help?

MCPglue is a lightweight API-wrapper. Agents can use it to:

- **Merge multiple endpoints & APIs** into coherent, reusable, **custom tools**
- **Expose them via one stable MCP server**, even as upstream APIs change
- **Abstract away authentication, pagination, retries,** and mapping logic
- **Keep their toolset lean, so they don't get overwhelmed or go rogue**

Use MCPglue to let your agent run cross-API workflows reliably, like fetching transactions in Stripe and updating them in Hubspot, to build ambient agents that react to app triggers or to wrap your own API into capabilities agents can use.

The superglue MCP server is available at the `/mcp` endpoint of your superglue instance.

- **Hosted Endpoint**: `https://mcp.superglue.ai/`
- **Self-Hosted Endpoint**: `http://<your-superglue-host>:<port>/mcp` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/mcp`)

```Connection String for Cursor / Windsurf / Claude Code (requires mcp-remote)
{
	"mcpServers": {
	  "superglue": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": [
				"mcp-remote",
				"https://mcp.superglue.ai",
				"--header",
				"Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
			],
			"env": {
				"AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer YOUR_SUPERGLUE_API_KEY"
			}	
	    }
	}
}
```

The reason this request is structured in an odd way (AUTH_HEADER instead of AUTH_TOKEN) is because Cursor does not allow spaces within the args array, but does so for env vars. This might become obsolete in future versions.

## authentication

All requests to the MCP server must be authenticated. superglue's MCP integration uses a key-based authentication system just like the GQL endpoint.

## session management

MCP interactions are session-based. A session allows the server to maintain context across multiple requests from the same client.

- **Establishing a Session**:
  - To start a new session, the client sends an MCP `initialize` request to the `/mcp` endpoint (typically via a POST request).
  - The server responds with a `sessionId` (e.g., in a header or the response body, though MCP standard usually involves the server generating it and the client then using it). The superglue implementation generates a UUID for the session.
- **Maintaining a Session**:
  - For subsequent requests within the same session, the client must include the `mcp-session-id` header with the value of the `sessionId` received during initialization.
  - `POST /mcp`: Used for most MCP requests like `listTools` and `callTool`.
  - `GET /mcp` & `DELETE /mcp`: The `handleMcpSessionRequest` in `mcp-server.ts` suggests these might be used for session-specific operations, requiring the `mcp-session-id` header. For example, to check session status or explicitly close a session if implemented.

## superglue tools available via MCP

The following tools are exposed by superglue's MCP server. The input schemas are defined using Zod in `mcp-server.ts`.

### 1. `superglue_execute_tool`

- **Description**: Execute a specific Superglue tool by ID. Use this when you know the exact tool needed for a task.
- **Input Schema**: `ExecuteToolInputSchema`
  - `id`: The ID of the tool to execute.
  - `payload`: (Optional) JSON payload to pass to the tool.
  - `credentials`: (Optional) JSON credentials for the tool execution.
  - `options`: (Optional) Request configuration (caching, timeouts, retries, etc.).
- **Important Notes**:
  - Tool ID must exist (use dynamic `execute_{tool_id}` tools to find valid IDs)
  - CRITICAL: Include ALL required credentials in the credentials object
  - Payload structure must match the tool's expected input schema
  - Returns execution results + SDK code for integration
- **Example Usage (Conceptual MCP Call)**:

  ```json
  // MCP callTool params
  {
    "toolName": "superglue_execute_tool",
    "inputs": {
      "id": "tool-id-123",
      "payload": { "inputData": "example" },
      "credentials": { "apiKey": "your-api-key" }
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. `superglue_build_new_tool`

- **Description**: Build a new integration tool from natural language instructions. Use when existing tools don't meet requirements.
- **Input Schema**: `BuildToolInputSchema`
  - `instruction`: Natural language instruction for building the tool.
  - `payload`: (Optional) Example JSON payload for the tool. This should be data needed to fulfill the request (e.g. a list of ids to loop over), not settings or filters.
  - `systems`: Array of `SystemInputSchema` defining the systems the tool can interact with.
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the system.
    - `urlHost`: Base URL/hostname for the system.
    - `urlPath`: (Optional) Base path for API calls.
    - `documentationUrl`: (Optional) URL to API documentation.
    - `credentials`: (Optional) Credentials for accessing the system. MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE ALL OF THEM BEFORE BUILDING THE CAPABILITY, OTHERWISE IT WILL FAIL.
  - `responseSchema`: (Optional) JSONSchema for the expected response structure.
- **Important Notes**:
  - Gather ALL system credentials BEFORE building (API keys, tokens, documentation url if the system is less known)
  - Provide detailed, specific instructions
  - superglue handles pagination for you, so you don't need to worry about it
  - Tool building may take 30-60 seconds
- **Example Usage (Conceptual MCP Call)**:

  ```json
  // MCP callTool params
  {
    "toolName": "superglue_build_new_tool",
    "inputs": {
      "instruction": "Fetch user data from system A and send it to system B.",
      "systems": [
        { 
          "id": "systemA", 
          "urlHost": "https://api.systema.com",
          "credentials": { "apiKey": "system-a-key" }
        },
        { 
          "id": "systemB", 
          "urlHost": "https://api.systemb.com",
          "credentials": { "token": "system-b-token" }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. `superglue_get_integration_code`

- **Description**: Generate integration code for a specific tool. Use this to show users how to implement a tool in their applications.
- **Input Schema**: `GenerateCodeInputSchema`
  - `toolId`: The ID of the tool to generate code for.
  - `language`: Programming language for the generated code (`typescript`, `python`, or `go`).
- **Important Notes**:
  - Generates code in TypeScript, Python, or Go
  - Includes example payload and credentials based on the tool's input schema
  - Returns ready-to-use SDK code for integration
- **Example Usage (Conceptual MCP Call)**:

  ```json
  // MCP callTool params
  {
    "toolName": "superglue_get_integration_code",
    "inputs": {
      "toolId": "tool-id-123",
      "language": "typescript"
    }
  }
  ```

## Dynamic Tool Execution

In addition to the static tools above, the MCP server dynamically creates execution tools for each of your existing Superglue tools. These are named `execute_{tool_id}` and provide direct access to run specific tools.

### Dynamic Tool Schema

Each dynamic tool has the following input schema:
- `payload`: (Optional) JSON payload data for the tool
- `credentials`: (Optional) Authentication credentials for the tool
- `options`: (Optional) Request configuration (caching, timeouts, retries, etc.)

The exact schema is derived from the tool's `inputSchema` if available, otherwise it falls back to the flexible schema above.

### Example Dynamic Tool Usage

```json
// MCP callTool params for a tool with ID "stripe-to-hubspot-sync"
{
  "toolName": "execute_stripe-to-hubspot-sync",
  "inputs": {
    "payload": { "customerId": "cus_123" },
    "credentials": { 
      "stripeKey": "sk_test_...",
      "hubspotToken": "pat-na1-..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Agent Workflow

The recommended workflow for agents using the Superglue MCP server:

1. **DISCOVER**: List available tools using the dynamic `execute_{tool_id}` tools or by calling `superglue_execute_tool` with known IDs
2. **EXECUTE**: Use `superglue_execute_tool` for existing tools OR `superglue_build_new_tool` for new integrations  
3. **INTEGRATE**: Use `superglue_get_integration_code` to show users how to implement tools in their applications

## Best Practices

- Always gather all credentials before building or executing tools
- Use descriptive instructions when building new tools
- Validate tool IDs exist before execution
- Provide integration code when users ask "how do I use this?"
- The server handles authentication, pagination, retries, and error handling automatically
