Superglue is an API translator that extracts, maps, and transforms data into the format your system needs. By leveraging the power of large language models, Superglue makes it simple to integrate and transform data from various sources with just one line of code.

## Overview

Superglue simplifies data workflows by providing:

- **Lightweight ETL**: Efficiently [extract](/api-reference/mutations#extract), transform, and load data with minimal overhead.
- **One Line of Code Integration**: Quickly integrate Superglue into your application.
- **LLM-Powered Data Mapping**: Automatically [transform](/api-reference/mutations#transform) data using advanced language models.
- **API Proxy**: Seamlessly [intercept and modify API responses](/api-reference/mutations#call) in real-time.
- **Flexible Authentication**: Supports [header-based auth, API keys, OAuth2](/api-reference/types#authtype), and more.
- **Smart Pagination**: Automatically handle a variety of [pagination strategies](/api-reference/types#apiconfig).
- **Caching & Retry Logic**: Achieve robust performance with built-in [caching](/api-reference/overview#cache-modes) and retry mechanisms.

## Getting Started

You can use Superglue either as a hosted service or deploy it yourself using Docker.

### Hosted Version

1. **Sign Up for Early Access**  
   Visit [superglue.cloud](https://superglue.cloud) to request early access to the hosted version.

2. **Install the Client SDK**  
   Install the Superglue JavaScript/TypeScript client:

   ```bash
   npm install @superglue/superglue
   ```

3. **Configure Your First API Call**  
   Create a basic API call configuration:

   ```javascript
   import { SuperglueClient } from "@superglue/superglue";

   const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
   });

   const config = {
     urlHost: "https://futuramaapi.com",
     urlPath: "/graphql",
     instruction: "get all characters from the show",
     responseSchema: {
       type: "object",
       properties: {
         characters: {
           type: "array",
           items: {
             type: "object",
             properties: {
               name: { type: "string" },
               species: { type: "string", description: "lowercased" }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   };

   const result = await superglue.call({ endpoint: config });
   console.log(JSON.stringify(result.data, null, 2));
   ```

### Self-Hosted Version

For complete control over your data processing pipeline, you can deploy your own instance of Superglue. See our comprehensive [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-hosting) for detailed instructions on deployment, configuration, and maintenance.

## Requirements

- **Docker**: Version 20.10.0 or higher (when self-hosting).
- **Redis**: Version 6.0 or higher (for persistent storage).
- **OpenAI API Key**: Access to the recommended OpenAI model (e.g., gpt-4o-2024-11-20).

## Key Features Recap

- **LLM-Powered Data Mapping**: Automatically generate data transformations with LLMs.
- **Real-Time API Proxy**: Intercept and modify API responses instantly.
- **File Processing**: Support for CSV, JSON, XML, and automatic decompression.
- **Schema Validation**: Validate responses against defined JSON schemas.
- **Flexible Authentication**: Integrates various authentication methods.
- **Smart Pagination**: Manages multiple pagination strategies effortlessly.
- **Caching & Retry Logic**: Enhances performance with built-in caching and retry strategies.
