[superglue](https://superglue.cloud/)¬†translates data from any system into exactly the format you need. It‚Äôs an open source proxy that automatically extracts, maps and transforms data so you don‚Äôt have to write and maintain complex integration code.

## Core Functionality

* Understands schema and format of data source

* Transforms data sources into your target schema

* Handles extraction, validation, and transformation automatically

* Creates deterministic transformation instructions using LLMs

* Validates output against JSON schemas

* Supports monitoring, error handling, self-healing out of the box

* Use as a drop-in replacement for any API integration or as lightweight ETL

## Quick Start

1. **Get Access**

Get your API key at [https://app.superglue.cloud](https://superglue.cloud) and sign up for early access to the hosted version. Alternatively, you can [self-host](/guides/self-hosting) superglue.

1. **Install the SDK**

```bash
# Install the SDK
npm install @superglue/client
```

1. **Make Your First Call**

```typescript
import { SuperglueClient } from "@superglue/client";

const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
});

// Transform any API response with a single call
const result = await superglue.call({
  endpoint: {
    urlHost: "https://futuramaapi.com",
    instruction: "get all characters from the show from the graphql api",
    documentation: "https://futuramaapi.com/graphql",
    responseSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        characters: {
          type: "array",  
          items: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              name: { type: "string" },
              species: { type: "string", description: "lowercased" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Next Steps

* See [example use cases](/examples) for common integration patterns

* Learn about [advanced configuration](/api-reference/overview)

* Check out our [self-hosting guide](/self-hosting) for deploying your own instance

## Requirements

* Node.js 16+ for the client SDK

* For self-hosting:

  * Docker 20.10.0+

  * Redis 6.0+

  * OpenAI API key
