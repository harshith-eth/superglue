superglue is an intelligent data proxy that translates between any API or data format. It automatically extracts and maps data into exactly the format your system needs, all through natural language instructions. With superglue, you can automate data extraction & transformation from any data source or API. 

## Core Functionality

- Transforms data sources into your target schema
- Handles extraction, validation, and transformation automatically
- Creates deterministic transformation instructions
- Validates output against JSON schemas
- Supports monitoring, error handling, self-healing out of the box
- Use as a drop-in replacement for any API integration or ETL pipeline

## Core Features

- **Transform Any API Response**: Convert data between formats using plain English instructions
```javascript
// Example: Transform a REST API response into your desired schema
const result = await superglue.call({
  endpoint: {
    urlHost: "https://api.example.com",
    instruction: "extract the user's full name and email, convert dates to ISO format",
    responseSchema: {
      name: { type: "string" },
      email: { type: "string" },
      joinedAt: { type: "string", format: "date-time" }
    }
  }
});
```

- **Built-in API Infrastructure**: 
  - Automatic pagination handling
  - Configurable retry logic and rate limiting
  - Response caching with Redis
  - Multiple auth methods (API keys, OAuth2, custom headers)

## Quick Start

1. **Get API Access**
```bash
# Install the SDK
npm install @superglue/superglue

# Get your API key at superglue.cloud
```

2. **Make Your First Call**
```typescript
import { SuperglueClient } from "@superglue/superglue";

const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
});

// Transform any API response with a single call
const result = await superglue.call({
  endpoint: {
    urlHost: "https://api.example.com/users",
    instruction: "get all users and format their names in Title Case",
    responseSchema: {
      users: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            name: { type: "string" },
            email: { type: "string" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```
