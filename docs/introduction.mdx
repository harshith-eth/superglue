---

superglue is a self-healing integration agent. Deploy it as a proxy between you and any complex or legacy API, and always get the data you want in the format you expect.

Prompt superglue in natural language (e.g. "get all issues from jira"), provide an API URL, and superglue handles the rest:
- Generates API configs by analyzing docs
- Handles pagination, authentication, retries
- Creates deterministic transformations (using JSONata)
- Validates and fixes data to match your schema
- Uses LLMs only for config and mapping, so runtime is fast and cheap

It's open source and easy to run in your own infra.

## Core Functionality

* Understands schema and format of data source

* Transforms data sources into your target schema

* Handles extraction, validation, and transformation automatically

* Creates deterministic transformation instructions using LLMs

* Validates output against JSON schemas

* Supports monitoring, error handling, self-healing out of the box

* Real-time log streaming via GraphQL subscriptions

* Use as a drop-in replacement for any API integration or as lightweight ETL

## Quick Start

1. **Get Access**

Get your API key at [https://app.superglue.cloud](https://superglue.cloud) and sign up for early access to the hosted version. Alternatively, you can [self-host](/guides/self-hosting) superglue.

1. **Install the SDK**

```bash
# Install the SDK
npm install @superglue/client
```

1. **Make Your First Call**

```typescript
import { SuperglueClient } from "@superglue/client";

const superglue = new SuperglueClient({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
});

// Transform any API response with a single call
const result = await superglue.call({
  endpoint: {
    id: "futuramaapi",
    urlHost: "https://futuramaapi.com",
    instruction: "get all characters from the show from the graphql api",
    documentation: "https://futuramaapi.com/graphql",
    responseSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        characters: {
          type: "array",  
          items: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              name: { type: "string" },
              species: { type: "string", description: "lowercased" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Next Steps

* See [example use cases](/examples) for common integration patterns

* Learn about [advanced configuration](/api-reference/overview)

* Check out our [self-hosting guide](/self-hosting) for deploying your own instance

* Explore [real-time log subscriptions](/api-reference/subscriptions) for monitoring and debugging

## Requirements

* Node.js 16+ for the client SDK

* For self-hosting:

  * Docker 20.10.0+

  * Redis 6.0+

  * OpenAI API key
