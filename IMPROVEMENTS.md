# SuperGlue Improvements

This pull request focuses on enhancing the robustness and resilience of the SuperGlue codebase, particularly in areas of error handling, variable replacement, pagination, and test coverage.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Variable Replacement**: Improved error handling in both `replaceVariables` and `oldReplaceVariables` functions to prevent cascading failures from a single variable replacement issue.
- **Workflow Executor**: Added more comprehensive error handling in the transform application logic with detailed logging.
- **Pagination Logic**: Wrapped pagination update logic in try/catch blocks to ensure that pagination errors don't cause entire requests to fail.

### 2. Robust Pagination

- **Enhanced cursor-based pagination**: Improved how cursor values are extracted and validated.
- **Better handling of invalid pagination parameters**: Added validation for page size values.
- **Graceful degradation**: Ensured pagination stops safely when errors occur instead of breaking the workflow.

### 3. Test Coverage

- **Restored workflow tests**: Created comprehensive tests for the `WorkflowExecutor` class.
- **Variable replacement tests**: Added tests specifically for the variable replacement functionality.
- **Pagination tests**: Added tests for different pagination scenarios including error cases.

### 4. Defensive Programming Practices

- **Null/undefined checks**: Added proper checks throughout the codebase to handle edge cases.
- **Sensible defaults**: Ensured reasonable default values when inputs are missing or invalid.
- **Fail gracefully**: Updated error handling to recover when possible rather than aborting entire operations.

## Files Changed

1. `/packages/core/utils/tools.ts`:
   - Improved variable replacement for better error handling
   - Added proper null checks and error recovery

2. `/packages/core/utils/api.ts`:
   - Enhanced pagination logic with better error handling
   - Added input validation for pagination parameters

3. `/packages/core/workflow/workflow-executor.ts`:
   - Improved transform application with better error handling
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

4. New test files:
   - `/packages/core/workflow/__tests__/workflow-executor.test.ts`
   - `/packages/core/utils/__tests__/variable-replacement.test.ts`
   - `/packages/core/utils/__tests__/pagination-handling.test.ts`

## Testing

The added test suite covers all of the changes made and ensures they function as expected. Run the tests using:

```bash
npm run test
```

These improvements enhance the reliability of SuperGlue when handling real-world API interactions, complex data transformations, and edge cases.
