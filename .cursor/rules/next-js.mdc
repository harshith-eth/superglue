# Rules
always use functional react code. always write include typescript type annotations.
in nextjs, always use the App Router pattern not the Pages Router pattern.

always use shadcn ui components, if possible those already in our library or ask to install new ones.
use tailwind classes instead of CSS to style HTML elements if possible.
name handlers with the handle prefix, use descriptive variable names.

use early returns to make code more readable.
